#### [SFHsounds.com](https://sfhsounds.com) is a fun site I threw together for a few fellow coworkers and I to use to have some fun at work.

The idea came from [JavaScript Drum Kit](https://github.com/wesbos/JavaScript30/tree/master/01%20-%20JavaScript%20Drum%20Kit) from Wes Bos' [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/) course.
